# Stock Prediction Using Facebook Prophet

## Overview

This project uses the Facebook Prophet model to forecast stock prices based on real-time data extracted from Yahoo Finance using the Yfinance library. The predictions are visualized using the Plotly library and deployed as a web dashboard using the Streamlit framework.

## Dependencies

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Yfinance
- Facebook Prophet
- Plotly
- Streamlit

You can install them using the following commands:

```bash
pip install yfinance
pip install fbprophet
pip install plotly
pip install streamlit
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-prediction.git
cd stock-prediction
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will launch the web dashboard where you can interact with the stock prediction model.

## How It Works

1. **Data Extraction:**
   - The Yfinance library is used to extract real-time stock-related data from the Yahoo Finance website.

2. **Model Training:**
   - Facebook Prophet is employed to build the forecasting model based on historical stock data.

3. **Visualization:**
   - The Plotly library is utilized to create interactive line graphs for visualizing both live and predicted stock data.

4. **Deployment:**
   - The Streamlit framework is used to deploy the machine learning model as a web dashboard.

## Usage

1. Open the Streamlit dashboard by running the `streamlit run app.py` command.

2. Interact with the user-friendly interface to input stock information and view live/predicted data.
